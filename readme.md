# CodingClass

We are teaching aspiring developers in a free Java Class at work. This project contains examples we discussed in class for students to download and test.

## Installation

- Download this project. As of this this writing this is no need to add Maven/Gradle or any specific libraries.
- Set the src as a "Sources" folder in your chosen IDE

## Running
